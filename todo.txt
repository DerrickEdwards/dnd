createRow function is being added to create and return the "replace" layout row

=== Wednesday January 11
The removeItem() function is not finding the id of the $clone item passed to it so that it can be logged.
    I am not sure what the JQuery object being passed ($clone) really is, but it seems from the debugger that the html element is child of the object so 
    it may be necessary to do a $clone.find( xxxx ), where "xxxx" is something, to find the element with and then the id within the object.
    Look at the "item" being passed into the function and you will see that the "id" is there but seems to be part of the first child.


v=== very next thing

When the component is dropped change it to be the workspace object.  the components on the palette are just supposed to be representations of the objects.  
For example, the components in this first phase should represent layout objects such as single col rows, double column rows, x-col rows.  
Later there will be an actual components list to drop into the cells in the rows.

=== future stuff ===

develop a data structure that gives items attributes

When an item has another item dropped on it, it should grow in size to accommidate the new item.
This is made more difficult given nesting of items.

Idea: 
All of the nesting and resizing could be done in a data structure and then reflected in the DOM.  This would be much like a shadow DOM.
A "resize" function is called on a given item which counts the number of childern, sums up their size attributes and resizes the item to be large enough to hold all of it's children. 
The resize event is then called on that item's parent object since every parent container will have to get bigger.
Will this actually require a shadow DOM?  How will it look on the page as everything is resizing?



Assumption: 
For the moment dropped items can append to the parent, sorting will come later.
