develop a data structure that gives items attributes

When an item has another item dropped on it, it should grow in size to accommidate the new item.
This is made more difficult given nesting of items.

Idea: 
All of the nesting and resizing could be done in a data structure and then reflected in the DOM.  This would be much like a shadow DOM.
A "resize" function is called on a given item which counts the number of childern, sums up their size attributes and resizes the item to be large enough to hold all of it's children. 
The resize event is then called on that item's parent object since every parent container will have to get bigger.
Will this actually require a shadow DOM?  How will it look on the page as everything is resizing?



Assumption: 
For the moment dropped items can append to the parent, sorting will come later.
